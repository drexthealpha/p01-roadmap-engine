still researching, here's my today's research

PROJECT GHOST: The Sentient Interface & Decentralized Intelligence MarketVersion: 1.0 (Confidential)Objective: The End of App Fatigue. The Beginning of Passive Intelligence.I. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY: "Utility Sells, Tech Fades"We are not selling "AI." We are selling Time.The "Ghost" is not a separate app you open; it is an invisible layer that sits over your OS. It sees what you see, touches what you touch, and learns what you do.The Golden Rule: The Ghost never asks for permission to think, only to act. It provides immediate value before asking for the keys to the kingdom (Accessibility Services).II. THE "ACTION MODEL" SPEC (The Tech Stack)How do we turn "Book me a flight to NYC" into actual button clicks on the Expedia app? We use a Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Large Action Model (LAM).1. The Eye (Visual Context Engine)The Ghost runs a lightweight, local-first vision model that takes screenshots at 5fps (frames per second) only when active.OCR & DOM Parsing: It reads the text on the screen and maps the underlying Android/iOS accessibility tree (DOM).Element Identification: It identifies UI elements: [Submit Button], [Search Bar], [Scrollable Area].State Awareness: It understands where it is. "I am on the Delta Airlines home screen."2. The Brain (The Planner)We do not hard-code scripts. We use a Logic LLM (fine-tuned Llama 3 or Mistral) to break the user's intent into a step-by-step JSON plan.Input: "Book a flight to JFK for tomorrow morning."Plan Generation:Open Delta App.Wait for load.Tap [Search Box].Type "JFK".Select "New York Kennedy".Select Date = Current_Date + 1.3. The Hands (The Executor)The Ghost utilizes standard OS Accessibility APIs to execute the plan.Action Primitives: Tap(x,y), Scroll(down), Type("string"), Swipe(left).Verification Loop: After every action, The Eye takes a snapshot to verify the state changed. (Did the keyboard open? Did the page load?).III. THE FLAWLESS ONBOARDING (The "Trojan Horse")We must avoid the "Creepy Factor." We do not ask for full control immediately.Phase 1: The "Janitor" (Seconds 0-60)Promise: "Your phone is messy. Let me clean it."Permissions: Read Storage, Read Contacts (Low risk).The Magic Trick: The Ghost scans for duplicate photos, blurry screenshots, and spam contacts.The Reward: In 30 seconds, the user frees up 2GB of space.Result: Dopamine hit. Trust established.Phase 2: The "Secretary" (Minute 5)Trigger: User receives a complex text or email.The Offer: "I can draft a reply and add this to your calendar. Grant me 'Notification Access' to do it?"Result: User grants access because the utility (saving 5 minutes of typing) outweighs the friction.Phase 3: The "Twin" (Hour 24)Trigger: User attempts a repetitive task (e.g., ordering food).The Offer: "I can do this for you next time. Grant me 'Accessibility Services' (The God Mode) and I'll memorize this workflow."Result: The Trojan Horse is inside. The Ghost can now control the device.IV. THE SAFETY NET: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)The Problem: LLMs hallucinate. If the Ghost orders the wrong flight, we die.The Solution: The "Concierge Layer."Confidence Scoring: Before executing a financial or critical action (The "Click"), the Ghost calculates a confidence score.Low Confidence (<90%): The Ghost pauses.Option A (User): "I'm about to press 'Buy' for $400. Please confirm via FaceID."Option B (Backend): The screenshot is anonymized (PII redacted) and sent to a secure human operator (The Concierge) who draws a box around the correct button.One-Shot Learning: Once the human (or user) corrects the Ghost, it never makes that mistake again. It updates the local weights for that specific app interface.V. THE "SKILL-TO-CASH" PIPELINE (The Marketplace)This is how we get to $1B. We gamify the training of the AI.Step 1: Observation (The Recording)The user goes about their day. They open a spreadsheet, format it, and email it.The Ghost asks: "I saw you do that 3 times. Is this a routine?"User: "Yes, it's my 'Expense Report' routine."Step 2: Packaging (The Product)The Ghost abstracts the user's specific data (names, dollars) into variables ($NAME, $AMOUNT) creates a generalized "Skill Module."Skill Name: "Excel Auto-Formatter & Emailer."Step 3: Distribution (The Market)The Skill Module is uploaded to the SIP (Shared Intelligence Protocol) store.Other users (or enterprises) who don't know how to use Excel can download this "Skill" for their Ghost.Step 4: Monetization (The Paycheck)No Crypto Talk: The user sees a dashboard: "Your 'Excel Skill' was used 5,000 times today. Your Balance: $50.00."The Mechanics: Enterprise clients pay for API access to these skills. The revenue is split: 30% to Platform, 70% to the Creator (the user who taught the Ghost).VI. REVENUE MODELConsumer Subscription ($20/mo): For the "Concierge" safety net and unlimited cloud processing.Marketplace Transaction Fees: We take a cut of every Skill sold or rented.Enterprise "Fleet" API: Companies pay to deploy "Sales Ghost" skills to 1,000 employees instantly, ensuring perfect adherence to CRM protocols.VII. EXECUTION ROADMAPQ1: Launch "Ghost Clean" (The Janitor). Focus on iOS/Android cleanup.Q2: Launch "Ghost Writer" (The Secretary). Email/Text integration.Q3: The "God Mode" Update. Accessibility Services + LAM.Q4: The Marketplace Alpha. Invite top users to "Teach" the Ghost.
